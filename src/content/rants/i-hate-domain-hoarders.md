Here is a simple truth: **If you buy a premium domain and leave it blank, you are the villain.**

I will admit, I have 25 domains in my Spaceship account. But at least I have the decency to put up a "Coming Soon" page or redirect it to a rickroll. My domains are bad financial decisions, but they are _loved_.

But today, I tried to find a home for **Sidequest**. And I found out that the internet is full of squatters.

## The Exhibit of Crimes

I had a great name. "Sidequest." Simple. Clean. Perfect for an app about going outside.
Let's look at the graveyard:

### 1. `sidequest.com`

**Status:** BLANK PAGE.
**Price:** "Contact Broker" (aka: "More money than I will earn in my entire life").
This domain is sitting there doing absolutely nothing. It is a digital empty lot in the middle of New York City. The owner isn't building anything. They are just sitting on it, waiting for some VC-funded startup to drop $50k. I am 16. I have $12 and a dream.

### 2. `sidequest.app`

**Status:** ALSO BLANK.
Why? Why did you buy the `.app` TLD if you don't have an app?
The `.app` domain requires HTTPS by default. It is meant for _software_. If you visit this URL, you just stare into the void. It’s not even a parking page. It’s just a server error. You are wasting a beautiful name on a 404.

### 3. `sidequestapp.com`

**Status:** A ghost town from 2012.
I checked. It looks like it was built when _Gangnam Style_ was top of the charts. The copyright says 2012. It has those shiny Web 2.0 gradients and a "Download on the App Store" button that probably links to a deleted Flappy Bird clone.
If your startup failed 14 years ago, **let the domain go.** Release it back to the wild so I can use it!

## The "Premium" Scam

I love Spaceship because they are cheap, but seeing that "Premium Domain" tag makes me want to throw my monitor.
It is ticket scalping, but for innovation.

I just want to build a little app that makes people touch grass. I shouldn't have to add "live" or "get" or "try" to the start of my URL just because some guy named Dave bought `sidequest.com` in 1998 and forgot his password.

## Conclusion

So now I have to buy `sidequestlive.app`.
It’s fine. It’s okay. I’m not crying.

But to the person owning `sidequest.com`: **I hope your printer jams every single day for the rest of your life.**

**Stop squatting. Start building.**

I got sick of the default markdown rendering. It looked like a generic tech blog.

### Changes

- **Code Blocks**: Now feature a "Mac Terminal" window frame with traffic light controls.
- **Typography**: Inline code is now pills. Blockquotes are sidebar notes.
- **Config**: Switched to `Dracula` theme for syntax highlighting using Shiki.

It finally looks like code should look.

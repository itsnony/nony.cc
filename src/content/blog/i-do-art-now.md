Welcome to the design breakdown.

When I set out to create the visual identity for **Nony**, I didn't just want a logo. I wanted a _feeling_. I wanted a symbol that captures the duality of man and the sheer, unadulterated chaos of my brain.

You might look at this and say, _"Nony, that looks like you drew an 'N' with your finger on a trackpad while eating chips."_

To that, I say: **You just don't get Art.**

## The "Design" Process

Let's talk about the stroke width. Notice how it's inconsistent? How the top right part is thicker than the bottom left? That is not "shaky hands." That is **organic minimalism**.

I wanted to challenge the rigid structures of modern web design. Vectors are too perfect. SVG paths are too calculated. This logo represents raw, unfiltered humanity.
It says: _"I have a cracked version of Photoshop, but I was too lazy to open it."_

## The Truth (Because I'm a Lazy B\*tch)

Okay, look.
The reality is, I would rather rot in bed and doomscroll than spend 4 hours pushing Bézier curves around in Illustrator.

This isn't a logo. This is a cry for help.

It is literally just my handwriting.
And not even my _good_ handwriting. This is my "I forgot to do the homework and I'm scribbling it 5 minutes before class" handwriting.

I tried to convince myself it was "brutalism." It’s not. It’s just "I-would-rather-stare-at-the-ceiling-ism."

## The "I Should Be Doing Something Else" Guilt

My dad says I’m the reason someone needs therapy.
My gymnastics coach says I need to work on my landings because I keep wobbling.
My swimming instructor says I need to focus on my breathing so I don't drown.

And what am I doing?
I am writing a blog post about a squiggly black line I drew in MS Paint.

I should probably be at the pool. I should probably be practicing my back handsprings so I don't break my neck. Instead, I am here, romanticizing my own laziness and calling it "branding."

But hey, at least the logo is unique. You can't download this font on Google Fonts. You can only get it by having zero motivation and a trembling hand from too much caffeine.

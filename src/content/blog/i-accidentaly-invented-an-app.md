Hi! I'm Nony.

This is my new little corner of the internet. I wanted something that felt like *me*—not just another generic portfolio template or a standard dev blog.

## Why "Pastel"?

Because I like it. Simple as that. The world is too grey sometimes.

## What's coming?

I plan to share:
- Updates on my novel (yes, the one I've been rewriting for 2 years)
- Code snippets that I find useful
- Random thoughts about writing and life

Stay tuned! <i class="ph ph-heart"></i>

current status: it is 2am (mentally), i am staring at my spaceship shopping cart, and i am in pain.

if you look at my cloudflare/spaceship accounts, you will see 25 domains. 25.
that is not a portfolio, that is a cry for help.

and naturally, because i have zero self-control, i just came up with another one.

## meet sidequest ⚔️

i hallucinated this idea tonight. basically, social media is boring and fake, so i want to make a game where you have to physically touch grass to win.

- you "summon" friends with a timer (no desperate texting).
- the map has fog of war (you have to walk to clear it).
- you gotta bump phones (nfc) to add people so no creeps allowed.

it’s genius. it’s going to fix society. i love it.

## the problem

i built the website already.
it’s made in **astro** because i’m not a heathen and i like my sites fast. it looks sick.

but... i haven't bought `sidequestlive.app` yet.
it is sitting in my spaceship cart because they are cheap af, but i am currently "out of dollarbucks" (bluey reference, fight me).
so right now, i am the proud owner of a high-performance website that points to absolutely nowhere.

## the "tech stack" (aka my delusion)

since i have no money, i have to pay with suffering. so here is the plan:

1. **the app:** i am going to write it in **flutter**.
   have i ever used flutter? no.
   do i know dart? absolute not.
   am i going to try to learn it all in one weekend to build for ios and android at the same time? yes.
   (pray for me).

2. **the backend:** literally just a simple EJS thing.
   "but nony, why not use a real backend framework?"
   because it's just an api lol. i don't need complexity, i need it to work before i get bored and go back to playing minecraft.

## conclusion

i need to be locked up.
i have a 500-page novel to finish, school work to do, and 25 other failed projects. naturally, this is the perfect time to start a location-based social network with a language i don't know.

if i actually launch this, you all owe me a soda.
